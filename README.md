<h1>Atari Game</h1>
<p>Let's play Atari games, but with deep learning :)</p>
<p>It's time to dive in and learn about neural networks and deep learning! This is a significant but fun project that contributes value to your technical portolio and software development experience.</p>
<p><em>Your Mission</em>
Your mission is to build an AI that "plays" Atari video games. You will build 3 diffeent models that solve three different Atari games.</p>
<p>You will use the help of neural networks to solve problems using reinforcement learning and the Deep Q-Network (which represents the optimal action-value function as a neural network instead of a table).</p>
<p>Atari games have a large variety of screens, among other things, rendering it unsolvable using a Q-table. Learners must create an algorithm that "plays" Atari video games better than humans (and using all 49 Atari games to train the model is recommended!!). GPUs are becoming indispensable for learning problems that involve large neural networks. We will be using GPUs for training networks on larger-scale tasks.</p>
<p>It would be best if you started with OpenGym and I would start with <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/" target="_blank">CartPole</a></p>
<p>Your deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>a model that plays Cart Pole</li>
<li>a model that plays Space invaders</li>
<li>a model that plays Pacman</li>
<li>A blog post explaining your approach</li>
</ul>

## Description

This project centers around creating a powerful deep learning AI using reinforcement learning techniques. The focus is on mastering games such as Cart Pole, Luna Lander, and Car Racing. Leveraging OpenAI Gymnasium, Stable Baselines3, and OpenCV-Python, the implementation aims to push the boundaries of intelligent agent training. The mission is clear: to enhance decision-making capabilities through reinforcement learning and achieve optimal performance in dynamic gaming environments. This project provides hands-on experience with cutting-edge algorithms, making it a valuable resource for those interested in the intersection of deep learning and reinforcement learning. Dive into the world of AI gaming and explore the capabilities of this advanced system.

# Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository from the official GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newjasjanpython/03-Machine-Learning-Atari-Games-.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 03-Machine-Learning-Atari-Games-
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`. We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv  # If virtualenv is not installed
   virtualenv venv  # Create a virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment on Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
   ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you're ready to explore and run the project.

Certainly! Here's a sample "Usage" section for running the `Atari Game.ipynb` notebook:

# Usage

To run the `Atari Game.ipynb` notebook and explore the Atari gaming environment, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have completed the installation steps mentioned in the [Installation](#installation) section.

2. Activate your virtual environment if you used one:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the `Atari Game.ipynb` file and open it.

5. Execute the cells in the notebook one by one to understand the code and observe the results.
